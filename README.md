my api challenge for the Code2040 fellows program

this is a Python file that completes all the steps in the Code2040 Api Challenge

the program relies on the requests module (http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/) which can be installed via 'pip install requests' if you have pip or it can also be downloaded from the website
